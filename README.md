# The NextWeb Clone

> Clone of The NextWeb webpage with responsive layout

![screenshot](app_screenshot.png)

This project is the sixth one in the HTML/CSS module at Microverse
It consists of building a responsive website. We cloned The Next Web, a tech-focused magazine which uses media queries to gracefully degrade their site as the window size is reduced.

The page is very straightforward, so you should be able to clone it even if your CSS skills aren’t perfect.

We worked on all the requirements given on this project.
- Aligned all elements with float and flex or grid.
- Used a mobile first approach when dealing with media queries with 2 breakpoints (you should figure out the exact width for each breakpoint by yourself).
- Used semantic HTML elements for the header, the main content and the footer.
- We styled the elements to look like the real webpage.
- We used some CSS positioning techniques like Flexbox and Grid. We have ignored any ads, comments or interactive elements (which use JavaScript) and media queries.
